Soham

Currently an A Level Compsci and Maths student. I am looking forward to doing a Bachelors and Masters at University in Computer Science with specialisations in AI or Stats.

I enjoy applying maths to the world of CompSci and so this got me interested in machine learning and statisical learning. Finance is also a passion of mine so I try to find ways to combine my interests. This resulted in me udertaking my current project, a transformer based model that has been modified to be used for time series data, the Temporal Fusion Transformer.
I have worked in Python, Java, HTML, Javascript and Latex.
