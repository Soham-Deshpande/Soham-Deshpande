Soham

Currently a Computer Science student doing an Meng in Computer Science. I am looking to specialise in machine learning and financial computation.

I enjoy applying maths to the world of CompSci and so this got me interested in machine learning and statisical learning. Finance is also a passion of mine so I try to find ways to combine my interests. This resulted in me udertaking my current project, a transformer based model that has been modified to be used for time series data, the Temporal Fusion Transformer. I want to do further research and exploration into the Fourier series and the subseuqent Fourier analysis.
I am also looking into the role of computers and algorithms in the world of finance. My newest project will endeavour to explore the Black Scholes equation.
I have worked in Python, Java, HTML, Javascript and Latex.
